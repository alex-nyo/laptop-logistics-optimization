# Laptop Logistics Optimization

A comprehensive initiative to streamline laptop shipping and onboarding processes within Support Engineering.

## Overview

Support Engineering handles approximately **78 laptop shipments monthly** for:
- New hire onboarding
- Break/fix replacements
- Hardware refresh cycles

This project aims to reduce inefficiencies in the shipping workflow while decreasing post-shipment support tickets.

## Project Goals

1. **Reduce manual processes** — Eliminate time-consuming, repetitive tasks
2. **Minimize supply chain dependencies** — Simplify consumable management
3. **Decrease support tickets** — Prevent common user issues through better documentation
4. **Standardize workflows** — Create consistent, documented procedures
