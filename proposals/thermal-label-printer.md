# Shipping Process Improvement Proposal: Thermal Label Printer

**Status:** ✅ Submitted to Management  
**Date:** January 2026  
**Author:** Support Engineering

---

## Summary

This proposal recommends implementing a thermal label printer to streamline the laptop shipping process within Support Engineering. The current workflow relies on standard office printing with adhesive sleeves, creating supply chain dependencies and inefficiencies that consume approximately **6.5 hours of technician time per month**.

The proposed solution requires a one-time investment of **$410 (Year 1)** with minimal ongoing costs, while reducing process friction, eliminating supply dependencies, and improving label durability and readability.

## Current State

### Shipping Volume

Based on delivery confirmations from the FedEx shared mailbox (2-month retention period), Support Engineering shipped **157 laptops from Bellevue over the last two months**. This translates to:

- ~78 shipments per month
- 19–20 shipments per week

These shipments support new hire onboarding, break/fix replacements, and hardware refresh cycles.

### Current Label Creation Process

The existing process for creating shipping labels involves the following steps:

1. Technician manually enters shipping information on the FedEx website using data from the ticket or user correspondence
2. Label is printed on standard copy paper using an office printer
3. Printed label is inserted into an adhesive plastic sleeve
4. Sleeve is attached to the shipping box

**Time impact:** ~5 minutes per shipment = ~100 minutes/week = **~6.5 hours/month**

### Identified Pain Points

| Issue | Impact |
|-------|--------|
| **Toner dependency** | Low toner levels result in faded, difficult-to-read labels that may cause delivery issues |
| **Sleeve inventory management** | Running out of adhesive sleeves halts the shipping process until new supplies arrive |
| **Multiple supply dependencies** | Managing toner, copy paper, and sleeves creates multiple potential failure points |
| **Label durability** | Paper labels in sleeves are more susceptible to damage during transit compared to direct thermal labels |

---

## Proposed Solution

We recommend purchasing a dedicated thermal label printer for the shipping workstation. Thermal printers apply heat directly to specially coated labels, eliminating the need for ink, toner, or additional protective sleeves.

### Recommended Equipment

| Item | Details |
|------|---------|
| **Printer** | HP Direct Thermal Label Printer with Ethernet Connection — Industrial-Grade, 300 DPI |
| **Connectivity** | Ethernet (network-connected for shared use) |
| **Resolution** | 300 DPI (high-quality, scannable barcodes) |
| **Labels** | 4 rolls (1,000 labels total) — covers ~936 annual shipments with minimal buffer |

### Key Benefits

- **Single consumable:** Only blank labels need to be managed, eliminating toner, paper, and sleeve dependencies
- **Consistent quality:** Thermal printing produces crisp, high-contrast labels every time regardless of consumable levels
- **Durability:** Direct thermal labels are moisture and smudge-resistant, reducing risk of unreadable labels during transit
- **Speed:** Label prints directly onto adhesive stock, eliminating the sleeve insertion step
- **Network connectivity:** Ethernet connection allows any technician on the network to print labels without physical access to the printer

### Contingency

In the event of printer malfunction or hardware failure, the existing copy paper and plastic sleeve method remains available as a backup. This ensures no disruption to shipping operations while repairs or replacement are coordinated.

## Cost Analysis

### Implementation Costs

| Item | Cost |
|------|------|
| HP Direct Thermal Label Printer (one-time) | $350.00 |
| Thermal labels — 4 rolls / 1,000 labels (annual) | $60.00 |
| **Year 1 Total** | **$410.00** |
| **Year 2+ Annual Cost (labels only)** | **$60.00** |

### Return on Investment

While the primary value of this investment is in process reliability and reduced friction rather than direct cost savings, there are measurable efficiency gains:

- Elimination of supply chain disruptions from toner or sleeve shortages
- Reduced time per label (no sleeve insertion step)
- Decreased risk of delivery issues caused by illegible labels
- Simplified inventory management (one consumable vs. three)

## Implementation Timeline

| Timeframe | Activity |
|-----------|----------|
| **Week 1** | Approval and procurement of printer and labels |
| **Week 2** | Delivery and hardware setup (network configuration, driver installation) |
| **Week 2–3** | Technician training and testing with FedEx label generation |
| **Week 3+** | Full deployment — retire sleeve/paper workflow |

---

## Recommendation

We recommend approving the purchase of the HP Direct Thermal Label Printer and initial label supply at a total Year 1 cost of **$410**. This is a low-risk investment that addresses a known pain point in our shipping workflow, simplifies supply management, and positions the team for future workflow integrations.

> This proposal is part of a broader initiative to optimize the laptop shipping and receiving process. Additional improvements, including standardized user instruction sheets and automating data entry on shipping labels, will be addressed in subsequent proposals.
